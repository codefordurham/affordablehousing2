# Affordable Housing

This is a second take on our [affordable housing project](https://github.com/codefordurham/affordablehousing_sf) on the tech side. We are getting our hands into Durham's relevant housing data by cloning the concept of the [DataSF Housing Hub](http://housing.datasf.org/data-browser/) and redeploying it into a more manageable tech framework for the Durham Area. We don't currently have a web hosted version but should remedy that soon.

Using [Flask Web Framework](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html), d3, and Bootstrap (HTML/css), OpenStreetMap

For quick overview (if new to project), check out this Dec 10 [affordable housing report](http://www.durhamnc.gov/agendas_new/2015/cws20151221/10833_PRESENTATION_ENTERPRISE_PRESENTATION_381541_671480.PDF) provided by consultant Karen Lado to the City of Durham

This is an emerging project born out of this initial [Project Scope Brainstorm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfjVL8-oBa3JkihRLWpDK6rIZHQ48Gc3Zxy5rM1ch4A/edit).

Project Brief:

Sustainable economic development is difficult to get right. Durham is growing fast and may be missing the window to get the right policies and organizations in place to ensure it stays a place where people of all socio-economic backgrounds can work and live. Durham already lacks 14,500 affordable rental units [according to DurhamCares](http://www.durhamcares.org/portfolio/affordable-housing-infographic). We don't want to live in a place with the same dramatic tension that San Francisco has experienced between the innovation/tech economy and those not in that sector. We want to be the model of sustainable urban growth in the digital age. We need tools to help guide the discussion.

Lack of public awareness around changes in affordable housing options in Durham and ability to track local inventories of rent within affordable ranges block by block as Durham grows is one major problem

Other Problems:

* How many rental units are available for people earning at 40-60% AMI?
* Startups & low-wealth communities are at-risk of â€œgentrificationâ€ 
* Ensure housing inventory is aligned with workforce development efforts
* Ensure affordable housing inventory is aligned with public transportation planning
